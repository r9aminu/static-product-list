## Layout and Styling Choices
The ProductList component renders a list of products, each displayed as a card within a flex container. The layout is designed to be responsive, centering the cards on the page for easy readability across different device sizes.

## Styling Highlights
Cards: Each product is contained within a card-like structure, achieving a clean and organized look. The cards have a subtle border and shadow to create depth, enhancing the visual appeal.
Typography: The product name (h2) is styled to stand out, while the description (p) uses a lighter color (#666) for a subtle contrast. The price is bolded and colored in green (#1a8917) to attract attention.
Flexbox: The use of Flexbox for the layout allows the cards to be evenly spaced and aligned, providing a smooth visual flow.
This simple yet elegant design ensures that the product information is the focal point of the application, making it easy for users to browse through the list.
